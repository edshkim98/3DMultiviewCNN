# 3D_multiviewCNN
Implemented Multi-view CNN for 3D classification using MoodleNet40 dataset.<br/>
The author from original paper uses VGG net, but I used a pre-trained ResNet34 and find tuned by building a classifier at the end.<br/>
Using this approach, I have achieved over 98% in validation dataset.<br/>
